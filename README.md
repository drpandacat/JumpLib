# What is JumpLib?
JumpLib is a code library for The Binding of Isaac: Repentance that allows for moving entities along a z-axis.

JumpLib was made to counteract common incompatibility issues across the mods that use their own systems for z-positioning, while also aiming to provide the best customizability and functionality.

# Why use it?
- Easy to use and set up, requires no dependencies, and can be included right inside of your mod
- 21 jump flags for modifying jump behavior!
- 11 unique callbacks + 8 additional player-specific versions that pass an `EntityPlayer`!
- Customizable familiar, knife, and laser follow behavior while their parent is jumping!
- "Tag" system for attaching identifiers to jumps, as to identify the cause of jumps or to only run code for certain ones!
- Cool bomb behavior, allowing for dropping bombs mid-air (configurable through jump flags)
- **Avoid mod incompatibilities through default JumpLib handling, various callbacks, functions, jump flags, and tag identifiers!!!**

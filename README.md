# JumpLib!
JumpLib is a code library that allows for easy and customizable functionality around moving the entities throughout the air, avoiding mod conflicts when used across multiple mods
### Features
- 12 functions (including JumpLib.GetData, JumpLib.Jump, JumpLib.SetHeight, JumpLib.GetOffset, + more!)
- 19 callbacks with various return types and optional parameters
- 23 jump flags to modify default jump behavior (familiar, laser, and knife follow behavior, collision controls, bomb behavior, + more!)
- Cool bomb behavior, allowing bombs to be dropped while in the air that explode upon landing (configurable through jump flags)
- Pitfall mechanics (with Fiend Folio Lily Pad support)
- "Tag" system to keep track of sources of jumps, and run code for only specific jumps
### Notes
- JumpLib is a work in progress! Feel free to suggest any features, contribute in any way, and report bugs if you come across any!
- (One WIP feature of this library is how tears and projectiles behave when fired from an entity while in the air)
